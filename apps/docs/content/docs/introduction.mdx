**Keylio** is a modern, type-safe utility library that simplifies **authentication** and **cryptographic operations** in Node.js and TypeScript applications.

It provides a unified, developer-friendly API for common security tasks, allowing you to focus on building features instead of wiring low-level libraries together.

<Callout type="info">
Keylio is designed to be simple, opinionated, and production-ready - without locking you into complex abstractions.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="Adapter Support">
  Currently, Keylio exclusively supports **Prisma** adapters. Support for other database adapters is still in development.
</Callout>

## What Keylio Solves

In many projects, authentication logic quickly becomes fragmented across multiple libraries and configurations. Keylio brings these concerns together under a **single, consistent interface**, reducing boilerplate and potential security pitfalls.

Instead of managing raw dependencies and repetitive setup, you get sensible defaults and a clean API out of the box.

## Core Features

Keylio provides utilities for the most common security-related workflows:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Password Hashing" icon={<Lock />}>
    Secure password hashing and verification built on top of **bcrypt**.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Token Management" icon={<Key />}>
    Generate and validate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using **jsonwebtoken**.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Identity Utilities" icon={<Fingerprint />}>
    Create unique, collision-resistant identifiers powered by **uuid**.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Type Safety" icon={<Braces />}>
    Fully written in TypeScript with strong typing across all public APIs.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Who Is Keylio For?

Keylio is ideal for:

- Backend developers building Node.js or TypeScript APIs
- Projects that need **simple but secure authentication utilities**
- Teams that value **clarity, type safety, and maintainability**
- Developers who want fewer dependencies and less configuration noise


<Callout type="tip">
You don’t need to adopt everything at once - Keylio utilities can be used independently.
